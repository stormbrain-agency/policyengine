# What's this file for?
# Mostly so that Github Actions CI caching works! (it looks for requirements.txt by default)
# 
# If you have written a fully working setup.py for your package already, 
# and your dependencies are mostly external, you could consider having a simple 
# requirements.txt with only the following:
#  -e .

# This means that running
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
# will be the same as
#    pip install -e .
# 
-e .
